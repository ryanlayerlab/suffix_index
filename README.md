# Suffix Tree

## `add_suffix(nodes, suf)`

### Purpose
The `add_suffix` function integrates a suffix `suf` into an existing tree structure represented by nodes. This function modifies the nodes structure in-place by either adding a new node for the suffix if it's not already present, or by splitting an existing node in case only a part of the suffix matches.

### Parameters
- `nodes`: A list of nodes representing the current state of the suffix tree. Each node is a list containing two elements:
  1.  A substring (`SUB`) representing the edge label leading from the parent to the current node. The root node will have the empty string (`''`) as its edge label
  2.  A dictionary (`CHILDREN`) mapping the first character in the child's edge label to node indices representing the node's children.
- `suf`: A string representing the suffix to be added to the suffix tree.

### Operation
- The function iterates over the characters of `suf`.
- For each character, it checks if the character is already represented in the tree at the current node's children.
- If not, a new node is created for the remaining part of `suf`, and the process terminates for this suffix.
- If the character is found, the function compares the suffix with the substring of the found node to check how much of it matches.
- If a mismatch is found before the end of the node's substring, a new intermediate node is created to represent the common prefix, and the original node is split into two parts: the common prefix and the remaining substring.
- This process is repeated until the entire suffix has been processed.

### Notes

- This function is called iteratively by `build_suffix_tree for each` suffix of the input text.
- The constants `CHILDREN` and `SUB` are assumed predefined indices or keys that correspond to the children dictionary and the substring part of a node, respectively. 

## `build_suffix_tree(text)`

### Purpose

The `build_suffix_tree` function constructs a suffix tree for a given input string text. It initializes the tree structure and iteratively adds each suffix of text to the tree using the add_suffix function.

### Parameters

- `text`: The input string for which the suffix tree is to be constructed.

### Returns

A list of nodes representing the suffix tree of the input text. Each node is structured as described in the `add_suffix` function documentation.

### Operation

- Appends a terminal symbol `$` to the end of text to mark the end of the string. This ensures that all suffixes are considered unique.
- Initializes the tree with a single root node having an empty substring and no children.
- Iterates over each index of `text`, treating each suffix starting from that index as a new suffix to be added to the tree.
- Calls `add_suffix` for each of these suffixes, passing the current state of the tree and the suffix.
- Returns the constructed suffix tree.

### Notes

- The suffix tree structure allows for efficient search and analysis operations on the input text, such as finding substrings, repetitions, etc.
- The terminal symbol $ is crucial for ensuring that no suffix is a prefix of another, simplifying the tree construction logic.
